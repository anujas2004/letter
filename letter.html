  <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

  <p>Thank you for your recent application to join our PhD program in the Department of Physics at the University of Awesome.</p>

  <p>I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your research at any time, although it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each semester are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: 1 September 2023</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2024</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2024</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

  <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
  <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€” as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted I am most keen on exploring the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and other biblical transmutations</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect of funk bass on plant growth</li>
    <li>Using AI to improve your karaoke singing</li>
  </ol>

  <p>These are all exciting areas of research, and I would be happy to supervise you in any of them.</p>

  <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
  <p>Yes, you are right! As part of our orientation, we do have a dance-off between new PhD students. This is one of our traditions! We call it "The Thesis Boogie."</p>

  <p>To prepare, you might want to brush up on the following classic moves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Moonwalk</li>
    <li>Robot</li>
    <li>Single Ladies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>

  <p>Best wishes,</p>

  <p>Dr. Eleanor Gaye</p>
